# FurEver App

FurEver helps users sort through available pets by pet type, size, sex, and age group.  Pulling from the PetFinder API, you can browse all pet profiles with available pictures and relevant information, and filter down your search.

Currently it is a prototype.

Click on the FurEver logo to see all pets available or select particular pet category in order to filter by type.   There other filters are available such as age group (young, adult, senior), sex, and size.

Once you find your perfect match, click on the card to get more information on your selection.
